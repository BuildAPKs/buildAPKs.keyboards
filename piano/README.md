# Piano

Virtual piano for Android.

Based on Hexiano (https://gitorious.org/hexiano).

Original sounds from http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html.

Displays two rows of keys, one for each octave, occupying the whole screen.

Access the menu by pressing volume up and volume down keys simultaneously.

Just a simple amateur project. Contributions, forks, etc., are welcome.
